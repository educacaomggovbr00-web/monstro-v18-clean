/**
 * B.5 mixed-segment composer plan.
 *
 * `SmartRenderEngine.analyzeTimeline` produces per-clip [SmartRenderEngine.RenderSegment]s
 * and `planRuns` groups them into contiguous same-flag [SmartRenderEngine.RenderRun]s.
 * This composer plans the export-orchestration step: for each run, which engine
 * to use (`StreamCopy` for pass-through, `Transformer` / `FFmpeg` for re-encode),
 * which temp file to write to, and how the resulting per-run outputs concatenate
 * into the final delivery file.
 *
 * Pure data — no I/O, no Android. The actual orchestration that consumes a
 * [CompositionPlan] lives in `VideoEngine.exportMixed(...)` (a follow-up
 * commit), and that path runs each [RunExecution] through the corresponding
 * engine and finishes with [CompositionPlan.concat] via `FFmpegEngine.concat()`.
 *
 * Design intent (documented in `ROADMAP.md` Tier B.5):
 *  - **Don't pay the cost** of FFmpeg concat when the whole timeline is one run.
 *    A single-run plan returns the run output as the final output and a null
 *    [CompositionPlan.concat] — the caller writes straight to the user's
 *    destination.
 *  - **Don't pay the cost** of mixed rendering when no run is pass-through.
 *    An all-re-encode timeline is just a single Transformer pass; the plan
 *    flags that with [CompositionPlan.benefit] = `NoBenefit` so the caller
 *    can shortcut to the existing whole-timeline path.
 *  - **Surface validation** before the user starts a 10-minute render. Runs
 *    that are too short to keyframe-align reliably (< 250 ms by default) are
 *    flagged; the orchestrator can either widen the boundary or fall back to
 *    re-encoding that run.
