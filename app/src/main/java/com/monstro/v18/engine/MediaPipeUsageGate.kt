/**
 * P0 privacy gate for Google MediaPipe Tasks (selfie segmentation + face
 * detection).
 *
 * The bundled `com.google.mediapipe:tasks-vision` graph packages Google Play
 * Services DataTransport (`RemoteLoggingClient`), which uploads anonymous
 * `COREML_ON_DEVICE_SOLUTIONS` performance metrics (app id/version, task/mode,
 * invocation/drop counts, latency/elapsed time, initialization errors) to
 * Google whenever a Tasks object is constructed. Input media (frames/pixels)
 * never leaves the device, but the metrics upload means construction is not
 * consent-free.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - No `ImageSegmenter` or `FaceDetector` may be constructed while
 *   [isConsented] is false. Every construction site must return early when the
 *   gate is not consented.
 * - Denial leaves all non-MediaPipe editing usable — callers degrade to null.
 * - Revocation closes every live Tasks instance (via registered
 *   [registerRevocationHandler] handlers) and blocks recreation until the user
 *   re-consents.
 * - Consent is versioned: bumping [CONSENT_VERSION] after a material disclosure
 *   change forces re-consent because a lower stored version no longer satisfies
 *   the gate.
 *
 * Consent is persisted through [SettingsRepository]
 * (`mediaPipeConsentVersion`). A cached synchronous view is kept so the
 * synchronous `getOrCreate*` paths can consult the gate without suspending; it
 * fails closed (denied) until the first persisted value is observed.
