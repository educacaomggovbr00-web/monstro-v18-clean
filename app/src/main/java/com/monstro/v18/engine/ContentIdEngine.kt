/**
 * Content-ID / copyright pre-check using an audio fingerprint + AcoustID lookup.
 *
 * The Kotlin fingerprint is an energy-envelope hash — RMS over ~50 ms windows
 * quantised to a 16-bit bucket per window. It is intentionally simple: it is
 * not a drop-in replacement for Chromaprint's acoustic fingerprint, but it
 * gives a stable, collision-resistant hash that lets users deduplicate their
 * own exports and gives AcoustID enough envelope similarity for rough match
 * checking if/when the Chromaprint NDK path is wired.
 *
 * The AcoustID HTTP path is intentionally a stub (no network call) until the
 * Chromaprint-compatible fingerprint lands — the previous implementation made
 * a real HTTP GET that never carried the fingerprint payload, so it was both
 * misleading and wasteful. This version returns the local hash reliably and
 * documents the integration hook.
 *
 * Every result carries a [LookupOutcome] because the stub and a genuine "nothing
 * found" are indistinguishable from the returned fields alone, and a user told
 * their audio is clear by a check that never ran may publish on that answer.
