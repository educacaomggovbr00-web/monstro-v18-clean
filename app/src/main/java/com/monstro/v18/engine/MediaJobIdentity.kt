 * Identity captured when a timeline-bound media job starts.

 * Clip IDs are intentionally not enough: relinking can keep an ID while changing
 * the source, and trimming/splitting/reordering can change the timeline position
 * that a waveform or proxy result belongs to. Keeping the identity pure makes
 * stale-result decisions testable without a decoder, WorkManager, or Compose.
