/**
 * R5.5c — Privacy dashboard data model.
 *
 * Single source of truth for every category of data ClearCut collects, where
 * the data lives, what user controls exist, and how the user can export or
 * delete it. The Settings → Privacy dashboard Composable consumes this
 * model directly so the displayed surface is automatically in sync with
 * what the engines actually do.
 *
 * The dashboard is **also** the source for any future Play Store data-safety
 * form changes — if a category is not represented here, it must not be
 * collected. New categories are added by appending a [Category] entry plus
 * a [DashboardEntry] with the engine that owns the data.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin. Tests verify the invariants the dashboard's UX depends on
 * (no on-by-default cloud collection, every entry has a delete action,
 * every entry references its retention policy).
