/**
 * Orchestrator for the Cut Assistant ("Review proposed cuts") workflow described
 * in [ROADMAP.md](file:./ROADMAP.md) Tier C.2 / R4.5.
 *
 * Pure planner — never mutates state. Combines per-clip silence detection (RMS
 * over the clip waveform) with optional Whisper word-level filler-token
 * detection, normalises every proposal into timeline coordinates, sorts and
 * merges overlapping ranges, and returns a [ReviewSet] of accept/reject
 * candidates the UI can present non-destructively.
 *
 * Translating accepted proposals into edits is intentionally a separate concern
 * from generating them — see [planAcceptedOperations]. The result is a list of
 * [CutOperation]s any ViewModel-level applier can replay through its existing
 * split/delete primitives so the entire flow stays inside the undo stack.
