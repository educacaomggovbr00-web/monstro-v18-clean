/**
 * R6.14 — Multicam SmartSwitch planner.
 *
 * Takes a list of synced multicam angles plus a speaker timeline (typically
 * derived from Whisper word timestamps with diarization metadata, or from
 * voice-activity detection alone) and emits a `cutPlan` — the ordered list
 * of `(timelineMs, angleIndex)` cuts a multicam panel can apply with a
 * single "Auto-switch by speaker" toggle.
 *
 * The planner is **pure** — no Android dependencies, no I/O — so it tests
 * exhaustively on the JVM. Bindings to the live Whisper / MultiCamEngine
 * output happen in the AudioMixerDelegate (or a dedicated MultiCamDelegate)
 * at a later commit.
 *
 * ## Algorithm summary
 *
 *  1. Walk the speaker turns in timeline order.
 *  2. For each turn, look up the angle assigned to that speaker.
 *      - If the speaker has an explicit assignment, use it.
 *      - Otherwise round-robin through angles in order of first-appearance,
 *        so the same speaker keeps the same angle across turns even when
 *        the planner runs without a manual mapping.
 *  3. Coalesce consecutive turns that resolve to the same angle into a
 *     single cut — a cut only emits when the active angle actually changes.
 *  4. Apply [SwitchPolicy.minDwellMs]: if a proposed cut would leave the
 *     previous angle on screen for less than the dwell threshold, the cut
 *     is dropped — too-rapid switches feel like flicker on real video.
 *
 * The output is the cut plan in canonical form; the multicam apply step
 * just iterates the list.
