/**
 * Factory for the color-blind preview GlEffect. Wraps the matrix produced by
 * [ColorBlindPreviewEngine] into a `ShaderEffect` the Media3 preview pipeline
 * already knows how to apply.
 *
 * A single shader source is shared across every CVD mode — the 3×3 matrix
 * flows in as nine float uniforms instead of being baked into the source as
 * constants. That lets the driver cache the compiled program and avoids a
 * link-step stall every time the user switches between Deuteranopia /
 * Protanopia / Tritanopia / Achromatopsia.
 *
 * The effect is preview-only — export paths never append it because the
 * transformation would bake the simulated color onto the output file.
