/**
 * Pure decision layer for the passive update check (sideload / GitHub-release
 * installs only).
 *
 * The privacy contract is that **no network request ever fires unless the user
 * has explicitly opted in** and the build actually supports the check. Keeping
 * that gate here — separate from the OkHttp call in [UpdateChecker] and from
 * any Compose UI — means the opt-out behavior is unit-testable without standing
 * up a network stack.
 *
 * `buildSupportsUpdateCheck` mirrors `BuildConfig.UPDATE_CHECK_AVAILABLE`, which
 * a privacy-store fork (for example F-Droid) can flip to `false` to compile the
 * feature out entirely.
