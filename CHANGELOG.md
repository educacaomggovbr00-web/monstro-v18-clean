# Changelog

## Unreleased

- The dashboard no longer spins forever when the project database fails to answer. A failed query now shows what happened and offers Retry, which genuinely re-subscribes, instead of leaving a spinner that could never resolve.
- Clearing the proxy cache reports what it actually did. It used to announce "Proxy cache cleared" whatever happened, including when files could not be deleted and when proxies were deliberately kept for an open project. A failure now says so and the control can be used again, where before an error left the button stuck busy.
- The OpenTimelineIO export gate now runs. The adapter it depends on is pinned in `scripts/requirements.txt`, its self-test exercises a real export shape rather than an empty timeline, and it round-trips ClearCut's output through the official adapter to prove tracks, clips, timing and rate survive.

## v3.81.0

Current version: **v3.81.0** (`versionCode` 299).

- Unified the primary interface around flat AMOLED surfaces with stronger type hierarchy. A source check caps corner radii at 12 dp.
- Added a persistent built-in template entry to populated dashboards and made recoverable project and clip deletion immediate.
- Replaced the clipped export preset scroller with two featured presets plus a complete overflow selector, then tightened output rows so the main export action stays visible at 360 x 800 dp.
- Kept the Settings header fixed, made narrow rows wrap without losing controls, and added sticky Close actions to long privacy and open-source panels.
- Stacked privacy metadata for phone-width reading and stopped preview titles, guides, or split overlays from colliding with playback error recovery.
- Expanded the visual workflow to 20 settled-frame golden screens across dark and high-contrast dark, including template, empty editor, media picker, populated editor, export, privacy, licenses, and tutorial states.
- Tightened user-facing English and Spanish status copy and removed the obsolete delete-confirmation preference.
- Bundle invocations now disable APK splits, so signed AAB packaging works while APK builds retain per-ABI and universal outputs. Release verification now follows the active QA instrumentation package and application-scoped shortcut targets.
- Recovery opens and diagnostic exports now leave Room plus every autosave artifact untouched. A partial project stays write-blocked until its explicit recovery choice commits the database and recovery file successfully, and legacy future-schema files are rejected before deserialization.
- Thermal export monitoring now uses Android 15 device thresholds, Android 16 headroom callbacks, and a ten-second forecast polling floor. Unsupported throttling and pause states are presented as honest advisories while export continues, and shutdown copy appears only after the encoder confirms cancellation.
- Public capability and model documentation now matches the generated runtime registry, version catalog, and native lock. Stabilization is listed as built in, removed Settings and AI-stub claims are gone, the FFmpeg profile is correctly documented as LGPL without x264, and parity tests fail on future drift.
- The pinned-key local release gate passed for debug, release, and QA instrumentation artifacts, including checksums, certificate sidecars, size budgets, package/distribution metadata, published sidecars, and 16 KB alignment. Its stale blocker and the shipped Media3 1.11 blocker were removed.

## v3.80.0

Current version: **v3.80.0** (`versionCode` 298).

- Added reusable offline stabilization profiles. The local-only `.ncstabilization` contract carries versioned lens, motion, crop, and sync assumptions, rejects executable or incompatible content before activation, previews fallback metadata and reason codes, and feeds the selected profile into the next analysis and saved stabilization data.

## v3.79.0

Current version: **v3.79.0** (`versionCode` 297).

- Added a translation contribution path with a locale guide, recursive UI literal budget, translated-resource locale-config parity test, and reproducible validation command.
- Dependency freshness now declares a 30-day evidence horizon, fails stale snapshot or upstream facts, and prints an offline report that separates stale evidence from intentionally held candidates with executable probe provenance.
- Extracted the timeline toolbar from `Timeline.kt` behind a callback-driven owner and pure zoom policy, with focused tests and ownership-size ratchets for the largest editor coordinators.
- Corrected clip sync quantization at the ±60,000 ms limit so fractional frame-rate projects remain frame-aligned instead of clamping to an off-grid millisecond value.
- Published a schema-v3 safe declarative-pack contract. Effect and style exports now declare minimum app version, required capabilities, hashes, and provenance; previews expose stable reason codes and reject unknown capabilities, incompatible versions, executable fields, and integrity failures before installation.
- Tightened the translation, dependency, and timeline ownership gates after review. Locale parity now covers arrays, locale XML, and Play metadata; freshness ages upstream facts under a fixed 30-day horizon; and all timeline zoom inputs plus overflow actions use the extracted toolbar owner.
- Reworked the dashboard, editor, settings, and export sheet around a flat AMOLED workspace with stronger hierarchy and a shared 12 dp radius ceiling.
- Added a direct built-in template grid to the empty dashboard and a denser recent-project row for returning work.
- Kept the export action visible after editable resolution, frame-rate, codec, and quality rows.
- Tightened settings density while preserving the full set of delivery, notification, timeline, storage, privacy, and model controls.
- Expanded JVM visual verification to 1080 x 2400 pixel captures for dark and high-contrast modes, including separate empty and populated dashboard evidence.
- Saved source targets, same-viewport comparison evidence, and a passing visual parity report for the four primary screens.
- Declared the OTIO 0.15 export and 0.15 through 0.16 adapter contract, rejected future OTIO schemas with an actionable warning, and added fixture coverage for lossy OTIO, FCPXML, and EDL imports through the official adapter gate.
- Named platform presets now require fast-start MP4 output. Export verification reports invalid, playable-only, or stream-safe status and rejects non-progressive preset artifacts across stream-copy, batch resume, mixed, and Transformer paths.
- New Project and Open Recent launcher shortcuts now route to their intended project flows, and static shortcut targets resolve the active application ID in the streaming build.
- Dependency freshness now covers Activity, adopts the independently gated KSP, Compose BOM, Activity, and OkHttp updates, and records explicit hold or retained-beta decisions for the remaining candidates.
- HDR export now gates the UI and export preflight on `FEATURE_HdrEditing` or `FEATURE_HlgEditing`, and diagnostic bundles record both feature flags for each encoder.
- Subtitle burn-in now escapes brackets, commas, and semicolons in addition to the existing filtergraph path characters.
- Audio tracks now expose signed, frame-grid clip sync offsets that persist through autosave and edit-decision JSON and feed the shared preview, export, mixdown, and stem timing path.

## v3.78.1

Current version: **v3.78.1** (`versionCode` 296).

- Added a translated Spanish Play listing with a current changelog, replaced synthetic listing screenshots with API 37 device captures, and repaired the clean-checkout changelog/checksum release scripts.
- Migrated project persistence to Room 3.0.1 and SQLite driver APIs; the v1 to v10 migration chain remains device-validated on API 37.
- Updated Coil Compose and its video-frame decoder from 3.3.0 to 3.5.0 after the unit-test, lint, and QA packaging compatibility probe passed; the timeline and media-picker review continue to use their independent VideoEngine and metadata paths, so the dependency change does not alter those measured paths.
- Updated the Compose BOM from 2026.06.00 to 2026.06.01; the resulting Compose 1.11.4 graph passed the refreshed dependency-verification hashes, unit tests, lint, and QA packaging probe.
- Updated AndroidX Core KTX from 1.16.0 to 1.19.0, added it to the freshness registry, and passed the refreshed Core/lifecycle metadata verification, unit-test, lint, and QA packaging probe.
- Updated MediaPipe Tasks Vision from 0.10.35 to 1.0.0; the regenerated capability/license surfaces, API 37 android-test compilation, three audio/export engine device tests, unit tests, lint, QA packaging, and refreshed verification hashes all pass.
- Completed platform export presets: one data-driven selection now applies resolution, aspect ratio, frame rate, and codec through the UI, batch queue, and render pipeline, while portrait/square delivery changes disclose the output-frame adjustment before export.
- Completed silence-aware Cut Assistant review: users can tune sensitivity and gap grouping, inspect silence/filler proposals (including multi-word fillers), accept or reject individual candidates, and apply the selected batch through one undo entry.
- Bounded deleted-template recovery storage to five recent files or 30 days, while preserving the current deletion's one-tap restore offer.
- Fixed custom-canvas export filenames so their aspect-ratio token follows the project output instead of the unrelated Settings default.
- Prevented export error cards from carrying a prior run's incident report into a new or unreported failure.
- Corrected Spanish orthography and completed the locale's plural quantity contracts, including the `many` fallback where Android lint requires it.
- Made batch media imports report required and available storage, show determinate file progress, and cancel safely while releasing URI grants.
- Corrected AI tool descriptions for face tracking, frame interpolation, and custom background replacement, with a uniqueness test guarding the tool grid.
- Hardened the Settings consumer ratchet with a negative used/unused fixture and documented its read-and-discard limitation.
- Expanded the native FFmpeg advisory gate with the 2026-07-22 NVDEC double-free review: the lock now records the explicit not-reachable build-flag evidence, rejects contradictory CUDA/NVDEC recipes, and self-tests missing reachability decisions.
- Removed the unused VideoEngine frame-rate probe rather than leaving an uncallable source-rate API with a misleading fallback.
- Pure single-source MP4 trims now use Media3's GOP trim optimization when eligible, disclose the full-render reason when they are not, and report all seven optimizer outcomes in English and Spanish; the unsafe MP4 edit-list path is no longer enabled.
- Added validated-internet awareness across model downloads, AI model controls, caption translation, and opt-in update checks; offline controls explain the dependency, disable before a request, and recover from connectivity callbacks.
- Made the appearance contract explicit: the menu now documents the implemented Dark and High Contrast Dark schemes only, and chroma-key colours live in content tokens while RGB scope traces remain documented instrument colours.
- Routed all application logs through a level-controlled, release-gated seam with a debug-only StrictMode policy; wired the product-health ledger across lifecycle, export, model, project, AI, and diagnostics events, included it with filled permission snapshots in diagnostic ZIPs, and retained redacted crash messages.
- Shipped a measured 30,384-line baseline profile generated by the API 37 profile collector, added managed/connected regeneration tooling, and recorded API 37 startup and editor-scroll benchmark percentiles.
- Replaced source-text contract tests with executable JVM behavior coverage: Compose layout measurements, playback/effect policy, export-storage preflight, snapshot recovery, undo/restore, and a documented limitation for the remaining static settings audit.
- Removed the unreferenced engine layer, stale AI analysis APIs, unused editor injections, and the unimplemented C2PA signer stub; the clean x86_64 debug APK fell from 140,218,263 to 137,133,686 bytes.
- Added offline hardware-aware stabilization: bounded platform motion analysis with low-RAM and thermal gates, live progress and cancellation, source-preserving review/apply UI, persistent motion/lens/sync/crop data, shared preview/export transforms, and API 37 device acceptance.
- Completed the AGP 9/API 37 acceptance lane: the managed Pixel 6 benchmark/profile tasks, detector ratchet, lint, advisory-floor, debug, and baseline-profile package gates are green; the connected QA baseline remains 17 tests with seven known emulator codec, accessibility-tree, preview, and migration-fixture failures.
- Completed LaMa object-removal acceptance on the API 37 AVD with the pinned 174 MiB model: still inference and an audio-bearing video both produced usable outputs, and FFmpeg now rejects zero-sample hardware artifacts before retrying with its MPEG-4 software floor.
- Completed the Room v1 to v10 migration matrix on the API 37 AVD; each hop now preserves the project row, frame-rate values, media-asset table/indexes, and v10 manifest columns, including a corrected v9 fixture for the non-null frame-rate pair.
- Completed Android 17/API 37 acceptance: the corrected `cmd audio set-hardening throw` policy smoke, media-processing foreground-service start, audio export, 2400×1080 resizability launch, debug/streaming packages, Room matrix, managed Pixel 6 benchmark, and baseline-profile collection all passed; emulator-suppressed profile cases remain explicitly skipped.
- Added API 37 device acceptance for dense-cut thumbnail memory, a software 1080p-to-720p render, two trims from one source window, 3000ms/3030ms A/V alignment, and rejection of short or empty outputs before `COMPLETE`.
- Completed the API 37 headless Android system-backup matrix: a large project restored its autosave/database scope while generated media stayed excluded from the cloud scope, oversized autosave data hit the transport quota, and disabling backup blocked new backup requests and reinstall restore.
- Added a headless JVM visual verification lane for the dashboard, editor, export sheet, and settings in dark and high-contrast dark modes, with committed Roborazzi goldens and strict accessibility checks.
- Added a secret-free GitHub Actions PR/master gate covering JVM tests, lint, QA/debug packaging, package/release identity, dependency/native SBOM checks, 16 KB alignment, deterministic artifact hashes, and build provenance evidence.
- Upgraded the pinned Media3 runtime to 1.11.0 after the QA compatibility probe, full release-gate matrix, generated dependency evidence, and APK alignment checks passed.
- HDR export overlays now keep native text and API 34+ gain-mapped stills in the HDR compositor; unsupported bitmap paths disclose their SDR fallback, preserve gain maps through scaling, and fail early with a named sampler-budget error.
- Transform, preview pan/zoom, colour curves, and keyframe curves now expose localized state descriptions and non-drag accessibility actions for TalkBack and Switch Access; editor action targets use the shared 48dp token.
- Media Manager now provides local name/note/tag search, missing/relink/used/unused triage filters, deterministic sorting, and persisted per-asset notes/tags across autosave, Room migration 9→10, archives, and managed-media sidecars.
- Batch export queues now persist priority order and planned outputs, support reorder controls plus active pause/cancel, retain eligible partial video paths for resume after interruption, and detect already-complete outputs to avoid duplicate work.
- Export completion now verifies requested versus actual video/audio codecs, container, dimensions, frame rate, duration, and MP4 layout; Media3 fallback callbacks and rejected stream-copy artifacts remain in export diagnostics/history, while unavailable encoder probes fail closed.
- Export audio-codec choices now expose only the device-verified AAC path; legacy Opus/FLAC config values remain readable but fail before encoding instead of producing AAC output under a false codec label.
- Added a CFR export toggle that normalizes VFR visual clips through the bundled FFmpeg cadence pass before Media3 rendering, persists in batch plans, discloses the rendered-only path in the export UI, and verifies constant sample intervals on an Android 16 device.
- Batch export can now queue each existing source clip's trim range as an independent output with its own persisted source URI/range, while uniform project exports remain available.
- Added a timeline range-selection tool that mutes audio non-destructively with volume keyframes across preview/export, preserving clip boundaries and autosave/undo behavior.
- Nested editor back navigation now uses Android's predictive-back progress with edge-aware preview motion, cancellation-safe state handling, and the existing immersive/panel/tool/selection/compound precedence.
- Android 15+ now uses Media3's platform loudness-controller path for preview/export audio decoding, applies a guarded HDR headroom policy to HDR editor windows and preview surfaces, and restores prior display settings on exit; older Android versions remain no-op fallbacks.
- Added an immersive fullscreen preview toggle that hides editor chrome and system bars, preserves the active Media3 surface/playback, and exits cleanly through the toggle or Back.
- Clip transform controls now support undoable horizontal and vertical flips that persist through autosave and edit-decision JSON while sharing the preview/export Media3 matrix path.
- Added portable `.clearcut-edl.json` edit-decision export/import with documented schema v1, preview-first routing, future-schema rejection, media-relink diagnostics, and canonical mapping for clips, markers, captions, and overlays.
- Media Manager diagnostics now detect embedded subtitle and GPS-like tracks; text subtitles can be converted locally to VTT/SRT, NMEA or container locations to GPX/CSV, and unsupported telemetry is explained without network access. Sidecars are bounded, stored under the existing secure diagnostic-share root, and share through a MIME-specific FileProvider URI.
- Android 10+ gallery saves now have an on-device MediaStore contract proving real MP4 exports appear in the Video collection with video classification, duration, and time metadata.
- `.ncfx` effect packs now embed validated `.cube`/`.3dl` LUT bytes within an 8 MB bounded payload and install them under content-hash-derived local names on import, so shared color grades no longer lose their LUT.
- Declarative pack hashes now canonicalize numbers using JSON's serialized representation, keeping float-bearing exports valid after a save-and-reload round trip.
- Metadata scrubbing now re-encodes WebP images without source metadata and routes TIFF images through the bundled FFmpeg TIFF codec with bounded input/timeout guards; failed conversions leave no claimed scrubbed output.
- Diagnostic ZIPs now live under a dedicated `diagnostic-shares/` FileProvider root instead of the private `diagnostics/` store; shared metadata redacts Windows/app-private paths, model URL query data, and stable build fingerprints while raw encoder errors remain explicit-consent only.
- `ACTION_VIEW` imports now accept secondary clip-data URIs only when the intent carries a read grant; the primary data URI remains supported without one.
- GIF and contact-sheet exports now replace the `{sizeMB}` filename token after atomic output completes, matching video and stream-copy exports.
- Freeze-frame insertion now honors the selected PNG/JPEG capture format for both bitmap encoding and output file names.
- Video frame-rate detection now prefers camera capture metadata and falls back to the actual video track's MediaFormat frame rate, normalizing fractional rates such as 23.976/29.97/59.94 instead of silently assuming 30 fps.
- Reversed clips now mirror timeline/source mapping in frame lookup, source-to-timeline conversion, and split boundaries, including the binary inverse used by speed curves.
- Incoming media and document intents now resolve MIME types, provider descriptors, display names, and sizes on Dispatchers.IO with cancellable latest-intent work, keeping slow cloud-backed providers off the main thread.
- Batch media imports now release only the persistable URI grants they acquired across review, cancellation, and storage-abort paths; dropped-file storage failures report insufficient space instead of a generic copy error.
- Exported project shortcuts now verify their project ID against Room off the main thread before opening the editor; stale or external IDs stay on Projects and cannot seed ghost rows.
- Batch export status pills and secondary project/settings feedback now use bilingual resources and plurals; localized editor-mode labels retain their canonical selection state.
- Export sheet playback now releases its player and codec lease with the composition, elapsed/ETA remain live during encoder stalls, and gallery saves move file checks off the main thread with double-tap protection.
- Accepted reverse-export fallbacks now surface a warning through the ViewModel toast and export sheet, including the completed export state; preflight and runtime copy share one deterministic message formatter.
- Editor canvases now resolve structural grids, rulers, scope surfaces, and template gradients through semantic theme roles; duplicated Catppuccin accents use palette tokens while signal/chroma colors remain explicit.
- Mixer pan and audio DSP now render through the same Media3 PCM chain in preview and export; constant-power mono/stereo pan and cross-buffer filter/effect state are covered by JVM and on-device audio-golden tests.
- Exported MP4s now preserve source creation time and rotation through Media3's muxer; GPS and namespaced stream tags are opt-in, while metadata scrubbing filters forwarded source metadata and disables stream-copy shortcuts.
- Removed the unused `BitrateMode`/CQ model and batch-plan field because Media3 1.10.1 rejects CQ at the encoder boundary; exports retain the supported bitrate strategy instead of exposing a nonfunctional control.
- Added bounded per-track A/V sync offsets with frame nudges and millisecond entry; offsets persist through autosave, participate in preview/Transformer timing, remain undoable, and force modified timelines away from stream-copy shortcuts.
- Settings now offers Replay Editor Walkthrough, which opens the editor tutorial immediately for the latest project without auto-opening it on ordinary editor launches or persisting an obsolete reset flag; the English and Spanish copy and navigation/UI coverage are aligned.
- Release R8 rules now retain only exact `Class.forName` probes and Room's generated database constructor while delegating Hilt, WorkManager, Media3, Compose, Coil, DataStore, OkHttp, ONNX Runtime, MediaPipe, and Lottie to their consumer rules; the minified release produced retraceable mapping/usage reports, passed native alignment checks, and reduced each APK split by 4.88 MB against the recorded baseline.
- Startup now removes only stale, app-owned pending MediaStore rows from ClearCut public output directories, recovering invisible artifacts left by a killed export or archive save.
- Media3 export timeout cleanup now routes Transformer cancellation through an explicit termination fence before deleting output, preventing a late muxer write from recreating a partial artifact.
- Speed-curve splits now carry their rounded boundary correction into subsequent clips, preserving the next clip and any intentional following gaps while retaining exact left/right abutment.
- Timeline clip thumbnails now use keyed Compose lazy strips with a bounded cache window, and off-screen thumbnail/waveform surfaces pause through visibility callbacks; deterministic policy checks and the existing frame-timing scrub benchmark guard the scroll path.
- ONNX Runtime sessions now attempt the bundled XNNPACK provider with bounded internal threading and retry on a fresh CPU session when the provider or model path cannot use it; Whisper and LaMa share the ownership-safe factory, and an instrumentation probe records native capability.
- Pure single-asset MP4 trims now opt Media3 into GOP trim optimization and MP4 edit-list trimming when no timeline, audio, visual, overlay, or speed edits are present; ineligible edits retain the full Transformer path, and the existing output verification remains mandatory.
- Media3 exports now enable CodecDB-Lite encoder tuning, round computed dimensions to encoder-safe multiples, apply Media3 unset-side rounding to proxies, and cap speed-processed clips at 60 fps; JVM and device coverage guard odd geometry, frame-rate ballooning, and valid output artifacts.
- Replaced hard-coded dependency freshness claims with a committed source-backed snapshot and offline provenance gate; refresh reads authoritative Maven metadata, AGP/Lifecycle/Room release facts are recorded explicitly, and catalog changes require a passing local QA compatibility probe.
- Added conservative Media3 export resume support for single, gap-free A/V MP4 timelines: eligible cancellations retain a partial, Resume writes to a distinct destination and verifies completion before cleanup, while changed or failed resumes clean artifacts and fall back to Restart.
- Added frame-quantized export ranges with Set Start/Set End/Clear controls; exports rebase media, effects, captions, overlays, transitions, chapters, audio gaps, and tracked state without mutating the project, and history records the resolved bounds.
- Added bounded SRT/WebVTT caption import with encoding, language-confidence, overlap, invalid-cue, and size diagnostics; accepted previews apply offset-aware captions to the selected clip as one undoable edit.
- Batch export plans now persist atomically with bounded, versioned JSON; interrupted work restores as explicit `INTERRUPTED` items, changed project/config fingerprints require review, and completed jobs remain in export history.
- GIF export now streams sampled frames into its atomic output, recycles each frame immediately, derives the logical canvas from source geometry, and uses a bounded primitive LZW table with streaming sub-blocks.
- Added an isolated `qa` Android build with a separate application ID, bundled timeline fixture, deterministic Compose tags, and on-device coverage for import, trim, split, delete, undo/redo, relaunch persistence, and scoped cleanup.
- Multi-selected local media now opens a capture-time/name/manual starter-sequence review with drag reordering, then appends the accepted sequence as one undoable timeline mutation.
- Waveform and proxy jobs now bind results to clip timeline identities, discard stale completions after edits, and requeue current waveform work when the timeline changes during extraction.
- Media health now reports container, codec, track-language, HDR/color, timestamp, and sync-frame diagnostics, with previous/next sync-frame navigation and export preflight risk disclosure.
- GIF export now requests aspect-preserving frames at the configured maximum width, prefers base VIDEO tracks over overlays, and maps palette overflow to the nearest available color.
- Cross-app media-picker drops now accept MIME metadata during drag-start, request temporary URI access before ingesting content URIs, and release the grant on success, failure, or early exit.
- Projects, templates, privacy, licenses, and settings now resolve structural colors through the semantic theme roles while preserving stable media accents; the source-policy test audits both feature trees for raw palette and hex bypasses.
- Editor orchestration now delegates document/recovery, archive transfer, WorkManager jobs, and preview playback sessions to fake-tested Hilt coordinators while preserving the ViewModel's state projection and cancellation behavior.
- Separated Android backup scopes: cloud backup remains bounded to project metadata, while device transfer carries validated app-owned fonts/LUTs and excludes partial copies; archive disclosures call out external references that may need relinking.
- Settings open-source notices now generate from the resolved release runtime graph and native lock: 240 runtime and 15 vendored native components are version-current, unmapped licenses or stale curated entries fail verification, and the reviewed FFmpeg source offer remains intact.
- Public release copy and capability metadata now share executable claim gates, including registry evidence, dependency-missing qualifiers, optional-network disclosures, and release self-tests.
- Reachable editor UI copy now uses parity-checked English/Spanish resources with a hard-coded-literal ratchet and debug pseudo-locale coverage for expansion and RTL checks.
- Raised compact editor actions to 48dp semantic hit targets while keeping their visual geometry, with localized labels and radio-button semantics for text and glow swatches.
- Track-level blend modes now share an explicit capability policy: unsupported edits are rejected before mutation, and imported non-NORMAL track state is disclosed as a normal-alpha export fallback requiring consent.
- Native SBOM verification now hashes the checked-in security patch canonically across Windows line endings while retaining byte-exact artifact and POM checksums; expiry, advisory coverage, and deterministic self-tests remain enforced.
- Smart-render export now consumes the tested segment planner: eligible timelines mix stream-copy runs with boundary re-encodes, verify each artifact, preserve authored gaps by falling back safely, and concat only after the run outputs pass validation.
- Rebuilt the vendored FFmpegKitNext AAR under an LGPL-3.0-or-later profile, removed x264, disabled every currently reachable FFmpeg advisory surface with named runtime refusals, and upgraded the native lock/SBOM gate to require the full CVE inventory and reproducible security patch.
- Added a shared safe declarative-pack contract with schema migration outcomes, SHA-256 payload verification, executable-field rejection, provenance reporting, conflict previews, atomic installs, and one-step rollback across style/effect/LUT/font asset flows.
- Added a shared, device-ceiling-aware lease queue for decoder, retriever, preview-player, and proxy-pipeline work, with cancellation-safe contention tests and live counts in diagnostic bundles.
- Added conformant OTIO timing/metadata export, FCPXML and CMX 3600 import parsers, official-adapter validation tooling, and a fidelity/media-relink preview that commits accepted timelines through the canonical project document boundary.
- Moved timeline interchange export validation, serialization, naming, and atomic file writes behind a typed coordinator; the editor facade now owns only snapshot capture and localized feedback.
- Routed manual and periodic project writes through one persistence coordinator so Room metadata/assets and the canonical autosave document share a tested write boundary.
- Extracted pure composition track planning and shared Media3 composition assembly from `VideoEngine`, keeping preview and export on the same tested selection/build contracts.
- Moved mutable editor-state construction behind a tested `EditorStateStore`; the existing ViewModel/delegate APIs remain behavior-compatible while screens observe a read-only flow.
- Conformed the unsigned C2PA draft to 2.4 generator-info and actions-v2 metadata, removed the retired training-mining assertion, and made the no-signing/no-embed status invariant explicit in sidecars and UI copy.

# ClearCut Roadmap

Current version: **v3.78.1** (`versionCode` 296). Last deep audit:
2026-07-17.

`ROADMAP.md` contains only work that can be implemented in the local build
environment. Completed work belongs in git history and `CHANGELOG.md`; research
context belongs in `RESEARCH.md`; blocked or operator-gated work belongs in
`Roadmap_Blocked.md`.

## Active Queue

Deferred findings from the 2026-07-17 deep audit (v3.74.157). Verified real,
not fixed this pass, mostly larger mechanical work or UI polish.

## Blocked Queue

Blocked items were moved to `Roadmap_Blocked.md`. Move an item back into this
file only after the blocker clears and the next implementation step can be
verified locally.

## Research-Driven Additions

## Research-Driven Additions

## Audit Backlog (2026-07-12)

Deferred findings from the deep engineering/QA audit. Verified but not fixed in
that pass, either ambiguous product behavior, a larger refactor, or negligible
practical impact.

## Research-Driven Additions (2026-07-22)

Reinforces existing items: this pass re-confirms the open P1 "Make public feature claims an executable capability contract" (extend it to cover the blend-mode and bitrate-mode gaps below), and the P2 Media3 export items (edit-list trim fast-path, CodecDB-Lite/rounding/fps) and Compose-1.9 scroll-perf item. All remain valid against the 2026 Media3 1.8 to 1.10 / Compose 1.10 release notes. `SmartRenderEngine`, `StabilizationEngine`, chroma key, motion tracking, `autoDuck`, loudness normalization, and on-device `WhisperEngine` captions already exist. Do NOT re-add them as new features. ONNX Runtime is already 1.26.0 (no CVE bump needed). No numeric ID scheme in this file; items stay unnumbered.

## Research-Driven Additions

- [ ] P2: Give media scanning an explicit failure and retry state
  Why: The outer media scan exposes only an analyzing boolean and per-URI resolver exceptions are absorbed, so a provider-wide failure can leave users without a clear retry path or an explanation of partial results.
  Evidence: `app/src/main/java/com/novacut/editor/ui/media/MediaManagerPanel.kt:95-108,1073-1165`; the current scan catches resolver failures per URI but has no typed terminal error state or retry action.
  Touches: `MediaManagerPanel.kt`, media scan state/diagnostics, strings, cancellation handling, and unit/Compose tests.
  Acceptance: The UI distinguishes idle, scanning, ready-with-partial-results, failed, and cancelled states; failed providers and skipped assets are counted with actionable detail; retry is explicit and idempotent; cancellation never leaves a permanent spinner; tests cover resolver failure, empty results, cancellation, and retry.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P2: Establish a Compose accessibility and font-scale matrix
  Why: Existing smoke tests cover pseudo-locale and RTL behavior, but there is no broad font-scale or large-screen matrix for dense export, batch, and media-manager surfaces. Compose semantics and state descriptions should be verified as part of the product’s accessibility contract.
  Evidence: `app/src/androidTest/java/com/novacut/editor/ClearCutSmokeTest.kt`; existing locale/resource and semantic-theme tests; official guidance at https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility, https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/semantics, and https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing/semantics.
  Touches: smoke/instrumentation tests, `ExportSheet.kt`, `BatchExportPanel.kt`, `MediaManagerPanel.kt`, semantics, and strings.
  Acceptance: Instrumentation covers wide layouts, 200% and 300% font scale, RTL, and pseudo-locales; no primary action, status, progress, or error is clipped or hidden; controls expose stable labels, roles, values, and state descriptions; the matrix runs in the invisible device test lane.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P2: Add a container and fast-start compatibility gate
  Why: The exporter accounts for MP4 `moov` size but does not assert atom order or clearly distinguish a stream-safe output contract from a merely playable file. Android’s format guidance makes codec/container combinations and streamed MP4 ordering explicit.
  Evidence: `app/src/main/java/com/novacut/editor/model/ExportConfig.kt:81`; `app/src/main/java/com/novacut/editor/engine/ExportOutputVerifier.kt`; https://developer.android.com/media/platform/supported-formats; Media3’s current muxer notes at https://developer.android.com/blog/posts/media3-whats-new?hl=en.
  Touches: `ExportOutputVerifier.kt`, container parser/policy, export diagnostics/share metadata, fixtures, and instrumentation tests.
  Acceptance: The output gate checks MP4 atom order and declared codec/container compatibility, reports when an output is playable but not stream-safe, and does not make an unverified live-streaming claim; fixtures cover valid and invalid `moov` placement and supported/unsupported audio combinations.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P3: Decompose the largest editor coordinators around stable seams
  Why: `EditorViewModel.kt`, `VideoEngine.kt`, `ExportDelegate.kt`, `Timeline.kt`, `ExportSheet.kt`, and `ProjectAutoSave.kt` remain high-churn, multi-thousand-line coordination points. Smaller pure state transitions and explicit interfaces would reduce regression risk while preserving the current architecture.
  Evidence: Repository line-count and recent-churn audit on 2026-08-08; existing seams in `ExportDelegate.kt`, `ProjectAutoSave.kt`, and `EditorViewModel.kt` provide bounded extraction points.
  Touches: `EditorViewModel.kt`, `VideoEngine.kt`, `ExportDelegate.kt`, `ProjectAutoSave.kt`, editor state/coordinator interfaces, and regression tests.
  Acceptance: Extract one bounded concern at a time behind narrow interfaces, preserve behavior and dependency direction, add focused state/contract tests before moving code, and demonstrate reduced coordinator responsibility without a broad rewrite or new architectural dependency.
  Complexity: XL
